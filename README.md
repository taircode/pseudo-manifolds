### pseudo-manifolds

This is undergrad work from the 2011 Cornell REU on combinatorial face-enumeration directed by [Ed Swartz](http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~ebs/), here as backup to the original [link](https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~takhmejanov/pseudoManifolds.html).

## Cornell summer 2011 Math Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU)

This program outputs an isomorphism-free enumeration of triangulated 3-dimensional ***normal pseudo-manifolds*** on n vertices. It is modified from the original ***lextet*** program by Thom Sulanke that outputs an isomorphism-free enumeration of triangulated 3-dimensional manifolds on n vertices. The original program can be found in the [3-manifolds subpage](https://page.math.tu-berlin.de/~lutz/stellar/3-manifolds.html) or the [software subpage](https://page.math.tu-berlin.de/~lutz/stellar/software.html) of [the manifold page](https://page.math.tu-berlin.de/~lutz/stellar/3-manifolds.html) hosted by Frank H. Lutz.


For 9 vertices the complete enumeration is summarized [here](https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~takhmejanov/pseudoManifolds.html).

These results are referenced in Ed Swartz's survey article on combinatorial face-enumeration, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.0987.pdf, and in an article by Biplap Bissau and Ed Swartz, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08942.pdf.
