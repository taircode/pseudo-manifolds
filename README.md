# pseudo-manifolds

This program is a modification of Thom Sulanke's lextet program located at Frank Lutz's [manifold page](https://page.math.tu-berlin.de/~lutz/stellar/3-manifolds.html). The original program outputs an isomorphism-free enumeration of triangulated manifolds on n vertices. This modified version is a generalization; it outputs an isomorphism-free enumeration of triangulated normal pseudo-manifolds on n vertices. Related software by various authors is located at the [software subpage](https://page.math.tu-berlin.de/~lutz/stellar/software.html) of the manifold page.

This program outputs an isomorphism-free enumeration of triangulated normal pseudo-manifolds on n vertices. It is modified from the original program, written by Thom Sulanke that outputs an isomorphism-free enumeration of triangulated manifolds. The original program can be found on [the manifold page](https://page.math.tu-berlin.de/~lutz/stellar/3-manifolds.html).


For 9 vertices the complete enumeration is summarized below.
